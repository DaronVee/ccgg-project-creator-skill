# CCGG Project Creator - Quick Start for Members

## What Is This?

A Claude Code skill that automates creating new projects in your business operations with:
- ✅ All integration mechanisms pre-configured
- ✅ Dependency tracking built-in
- ✅ Multi-phase project support
- ✅ Validation scripts included

No more forgetting critical setup steps or spending 30+ minutes creating project structure manually.

## Install (One Command)

Open Claude Code in your terminal and run:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add DaronVee/ccgg-project-creator-skill
```

Then:

```bash
/plugin install project-creator@DaronVee/ccgg-project-creator-skill
```

Done! 🎉

## Use It (Just Ask)

Say any of these:

- "Create new project"
- "Initialize new incubator project"
- "Set up project structure for [your-project-name]"

Claude will ask you a few questions and create everything automatically.

## What It Creates For You

Every project includes:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project guidance with Parent System Integration
2. **README.md** - Quick start guide
3. **Active Projects Index Entry** - For cross-project searches
4. **PHASE_TRACKER.md** (if multi-phase) - Phase management
5. **Coordination Hub/** (if complex) - Dependency management

Time saved: **15-30 minutes per project**

## Example Projects Created

### Simple Project (10-15 min)
- Research projects
- Single-purpose tools
